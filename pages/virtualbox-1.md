## Virtualbox used to be cool

- Provides an isolated environment for each project
- Allows developers to easily spin up a new environment (potentially with multiple machines with different OS's to test network configurations)
- Offers more control over the underlying system
- Allows any OS you like and the option to run GUI applications

## Virtualbox is "expensive" on a corporate network

- Managing base images requires significant work (keep logging, monitoring, firewall, anti-virus and installed software up to date)
- Need to install and maintain several base tools to run the environment efficiently (vagrant, virtualbox, packer, ansible)
- Depending one project the hardware requirements migth be substantial 
- License issues with Oracle
