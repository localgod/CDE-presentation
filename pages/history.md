# Development environments from the 1930s and on

- **1930s:** Manual Configuration
- **1940s:** Punch Cards
- **1950s:** Assembly Language
- **1960s:** Batch Processing
- **1970s:** Time-Sharing Systems, Individual Terminals
- **1980s:** Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- **1990s:** Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- **2000s:** Web-Based Development Environments
- **2010s:** Cloud-Based Development and DevOps
- **2020s:** Containerization and Serverless Computing

Pre-1970s, developers physically collaborated on the same hardware. In the 1970s, the introduction of time-sharing systems allowed collaborative work but with individual terminals. From the 1980s, developers transitioned to using personal computers. Starting in the 2000s, there has been a gradual movement from developing on a local PC to utilizing hosted, virtualized, and containerized development environments, with a significant emphasis on cloud-based solutions.

<!-- 
- Programmers manually configured early computing machines using plugboards or patch panels. 

- The use of punched cards allowed programmers to input code and data in a more structured and organized manner. 

- Programmers began using assembly languages, symbolic representations of machine code instructions.

- Time-sharing systems allowed multiple users to interact with a computer simultaneously, enhancing collaboration. Text-based editors were introduced.

- Development involved writing code offline and submitting decks of punched cards for batch processing on mainframe computers.

- IDEs became more prevalent and the use of personal computers for development increased.

- GUI-based IDEs gained popularity.

- Web-based IDEs emerged, allowing developers to work collaboratively across different locations. 

- Cloud-based development environments enabled even greater collaboration, accessibility, and scalability. 

- Containerization tools like Docker gained popularity, providing consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
