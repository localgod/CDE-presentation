# Conclusion based on personal expirience

- I have tried them all and settled on gitpod for now
- While functionel almost equivalent codespaces are only provide as SaaS which may be an obstacle in some orgs
- While functionel almost equivalent coder.com require more managment for the organization owning the setup
- While functionel almost equivalent devpod is more targeted individual devlopers and lack the adminitrative tools for large setups
- Virtualbox used to be my goto development environment but I must confess that for my usecases it is simply to cumbersome to manage
